# Password-Security

## Description
This webpage was built from an "on the job ticket". It takes user inputs using alerts and stores them as variables. Using JavaScript, the user is able to choose how long they want their password to be, if the password should include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric numbers, and even special characters. The output password is completely random. If the user presses cancel at any point during the process, the action is immediately ended.
